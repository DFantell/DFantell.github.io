          <h1>Hello, Welcome to a page all about me!</h1>
          <br><p> My name is David and I created this page as a pre-req to a coding bootcamp called #VETSWHOCODE.  Currently, I am a Senior Recruiting Consultant for 3rd party agency that works closely with various Tech Companies in the San Francisco Bay Area. <p>
            
          <br><p> I am still in the Army Reserves but was Active Duty Army for about 10 Years prior.  During that time, I served as an Airborne Infantryman and a Recruiter.  I deployed to Afghanistan and reached the rank of Staff Sergeant.</p>
              
          <br><p> I have always had an interest in Computers and Technology and find ways to <a href='https://automatetheboringstuff.com/'>“Automate The Boring Stuff”</a> anyway that I can.  When I started recruiting for Developers and Engineers, I decided it would be in my best interest to learn a little about what I was recruiting for.  I read an article called <a href='https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-paul-ford-what-is-code/'>"What is Code" by: Paul Ford</a> and proceeded to start my coding journey.</p>
             
          <br><p> I started teaching myself Python by watching tutorials and YouTube videos and decided to create a GUI using Python TKinter.  I adapted this program to collect and analyze recruiting metrics and candidate data.  I would input this data and analyze t with Pandas then export to excel, PDF or HTML to create reports to present to clients and senior leadership.  After this was “completed: I pivoted to converting it to a Web Web App utilizing Python Flask, HTML, CSS and JavaScript- this is still a work in progress.</p>
              
          <br><p> During this time, I decided I wanted to pursue a career in coding and started looking into more formal training to get started. This is my introductory story.</p> 
          
          <br><p> Hope you enjoy it. </p>

            <h2>Early Life</h2>
            <p> Originally from Bronx, NY, I grew up in South Florida.  After graduation I attended the State University of New York at Albany where I studied Business Administration and played Division-1 Football.   After college I returned home to Florida and worked at various sales jobs until I joined the Army and was sent to Ft. Benning, GA for Basic Training.</p>

            <h2>Military</h2>
            <p>As an Army Veteran with 10 years of Service, I have earned numerous awards and accolades for my actions while leading multiple Teams, Squads, and Platoons in combat operations throughout the Middle East and South-West Asia.  On my first deployment to Afghanistan my small outpost was attacked by 200+ insurgents on the 4th of July 2009.  The military channel made a documentary about it called Attack on the 4th of July.  You can watch it below.</p>
